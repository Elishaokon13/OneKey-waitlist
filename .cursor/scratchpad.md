# Project Simplification - OneKey to Hero + Waitlist

## Background and Motivation

The user wants to simplify the current OneKey codebase which currently includes:
- Freelancing platform features (gig pages, posts, social features)
- Multiple subpages and complex navigation
- Social/community elements (messaging, posts, profiles)
- Complex authentication system with API integration

**New Goal**: Transform into a simple landing page focused on:
- Hero section showcasing identity verification/KYC with zero PII storage
- Waitlist functionality for users to sign up
- Remove all freelancing/social platform features

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Current Codebase Analysis
**Pages/Routes to Remove:**
- `/signin` and `/signup` pages (full authentication system)
- `/(lol)/gig/` - freelancing gig pages
- `/(lol)/projectpitch/` - project pitch features  
- `/(lol)/scroll/` - social feed functionality
- `/(lol)/layout.tsx` - layout for removed features

**Components to Remove:**
- All `/components/main/` social features:
  - `post.tsx` - social posting functionality
  - `message.tsx` - messaging system
  - `leftsidebar.tsx` & `rightsidebar.tsx` - social navigation
  - `mobiledock.tsx` - mobile social navigation
  - `profiletoggle.tsx` - user profiles
  - `toolbar.tsx` - social toolbar
  - `write.tsx` - article writing
  - `article.tsx` - article functionality
  - `createaccount.tsx` & `login.tsx` - complex auth forms

**API/State Management to Remove:**
- `/store/apislice.ts` - Full authentication API (register, login, logout)
- Redux authentication state management
- API integration endpoints

**Navigation to Simplify:**
- Remove complex auth buttons (`authbutton.tsx`)
- Simplify navbar (already partially simplified - commented out menu items)
- Remove mobile menu complex features

### What to Keep & Modify
**Keep:**
- Hero component (perfect foundation - already has verification messaging)
- Basic layout structure (`layout.tsx`)
- Core UI components (button, input, etc.)
- Theme provider and basic styling
- Footer component

**Modify:**
- Update hero CTA from `/signup` to point to waitlist
- Simplify navbar to remove auth buttons
- Replace auth button with waitlist CTA
